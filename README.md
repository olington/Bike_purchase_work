# Bike_purchase_work
The data used for this project is a publicly available dataset on GitHub on bike purchases and it was used to create visualisation for the project, specifically an excel dashboard.
Downloaded data was in XML format already and was cleaned by first creating a new sheet for all data as a safe measure then removing duplicates as well as a few other excel cleaning methods.
Data manipulation involved creating new columns to make data visualisation easier. “IF” statements were also used in data manipulation which was then expanded to become a nested “IF” statement to create the new columns.
Pivot tables was created to filter data for visualising the data. The pivot tables were then used to create Charts in visualising the data
